# Learn Slither

Start with `detector_template.py` and follow the instructions in the leading comment to get started.

Make sure that the `hello_world` detector functions as expected.

Then, progress to Challenges 1, 2, and 3.

### Rules:
- Your detector should only flag `bad` methods, not `good` ones.
- No function name comparisons can be used for iterating over the Challenge contracts
      - ie: no filtering based on "good" or "bad" function names.
